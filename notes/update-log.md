Created a basic project structure and some game engine primitives (2d vector, 2d box, entities, actors, cameras, game world, basic physics). I've also created an html page with some simple styling to ensure the `canvas` fills the entire browser window, and that we are always using a custom cursor. Initial cursor (as well as everygin else currently showing on the screen) is just placeholder and has no influence at all on what I will be actually using for a cursor.

I've implemented a basic game world and primitive camera. Allows me to create and place any object in `world space` and have the camera automatically figure out where to draw the object on the screen. If an object isn't even within the `viewport`, no resources are wasted on attempting to render it at all. You can `pan` the camera around the game world by clicking and dragging.

Further improvements can be made to optimize rendering of objects by grouping them into `chunks`, and checking if a chunk is within the viewport or not instead of itterating on every single object. There's some even further optimizations that can be made here that I will get into later when I work on this part of the engine. The camera has the functionality to move to any given point in the world, or focus on a specific object. The co-ordinates of the camera are rounded to the nearest whole pixel to ensure crisp rendering and reduce flickering by default.

The camera has an additional mechanism to allow you to limit how far it can scroll in any direction. I have this set to be limitted by the size of the world, which is infinitely wide for this game, however a current bug exists where it's top, left cornor is at 0, 0 and you can't scroll past this point (meaning you can scroll forever to the bottom and right, but not to the top or left). I need to modify the concept of a "Box" so that I can have the option to say that an object's co-ordinates are relative the center of an object instead of the top left corner. That will allow me to then say if an item has an infinate width, then the top edge and left edge would be at negative infinity instead of 0. I plan to eventually limit the camera bounds to `explored space` (which is why this ability to limit camera movement exists), but I need to build those mechanics first.

I've created the start of a debug view that shows the center of the screen, and where that is pointing to in `world space`, as well as a default rendering function for each object in the game, so that if it is rendered to the screen and doesn't have any textures or custom rendering code, that it will display a box with the object's name and co-ordinates instead.

I plan to improve the camera further by allowing zoom in/out functionality and having the assets drawn on the screen automatically swap out quality of assets appropriately depending on how big it is drawing what's on screen. As you zoom out, objects will be scaled appropriately, have their opacity reduced, darkened, and properly paralaxed to give the illusion of 3d depth. If you zoom out far enough you will just see fixed size icons for the units.

The camera will also likely have a few different modes depending on the circumstance. It will by default be following whatever unit you are focused on, while still bing influenced by mouse movement, but it will also adjust to a `fixed` zoomed in `battle view`, where the camera will likely be stationary. There will be a third main camera mode when you scroll out far enough into a `strategic view` that will let you scroll all over explored space viewing it more like a map with icons on it and smoke concealing unexplored areas. The plan is to dynamically adjust the game camera to seemlessly transition between these modes.

All in all, this is a solid foundation to start building from and adding things to the game world that can actually be seen an interacted with, and benefits both games.
